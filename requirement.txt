Email Marketing UI with Journey Builder
* Issue: Mosaico lacks automation, limited personalization.
* Opportunity: Build a Mosaico+Automation extension with:
   * Campaign journey flows
   * Conditional content
   * Drag-and-drop editor with mobile preview
* Inspiration: Mailchimp Journeys, ActiveCampaign, BeeFree.io
